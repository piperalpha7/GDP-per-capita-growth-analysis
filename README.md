# GDP Per Capita Growth Analysis(PowerBI)


I did this project as part of a Pioneer Technology Training Program at Albany Beck


This made me fluent with practicing the Power Query Editor as well as effectively use DAX


The dataset I used is has been uploaded and involved analysing the GDP per Capita fluctuations for all the countries


The countries in the dataset were also classified in categories like Income Group and Region, which is why I chose to use these categories as report pages of my PowerBI Analysis


I went about my analysis by first transposing the dataset and my PowerBI report consisted of the following pages:

## Overview

This Page Broadly described the number of countries falling in each category(Income Group, Region) and the average growth percentage in each category.



## Income Group


![image](https://github.com/piperalpha7/GDP-per-capita-growth-analysis/assets/94968239/6105e7d3-28e1-447c-856f-83af39b74b74)

I identified which were the countries that either contributed Positively or Negatively in the GDP per capita percentage change and  further researched the reasons as 
listed below:

### Low Income Group

1. South Sudan(Negative) :- Civil Conflict before and after independence in 2011.

2. Yemen(Negative) :- Political Instabilty since 2014

### Upper Middle Income Group

1. Bosnia(Positive) :- Post war recovery, Economic Regorms, Stable Government.


### Undefined

There was only 1 country which wasnt classified into either of the Income Groups and that is Venezuela.

The reasons behind this could be Political Instability, Social Protests, Dependency on Oil, HyperInflation, Economic Sanctions by other countries


### High Income Group

1. South Korea(Positive) :- Export oriented diversified economy dealing in electronics, automobiles and heavy machinery.

2. Caicos Island(Negative) :- Tourism dependent hence limited diversification.


### Lower Middle Income Group

1. Bhutan(Positive) :- Hydropower plant development with the collaboration of India.

2. Ukraine(Negative) :- Faced war with Russia in 2022.

3. Haiti(Negative) - Military coupe in 1991. Economic decline. It is an island susceptible to Natural Disasters



## Region 

Just like above I aimed to identify the countries which either caused growth or fall in their repective region

### North America

This Region consisted of 3 countries viz. Bermuda, Canada, United States. Although they are High Income countries, they are consistently experiencial 
a fall in their GDP per capita.


### South Asia

Consistently grown even in the year 2009 where almost all the countries were experiencing a fall in their economies.


### Sub-Saharan Africa

Regression line constant. Some countries do well while Others (south Sudan) not so well.


### East Asia and Pacific

China and South Korea contributed to the positive growth while the islands constituted the fall in the GDP per capita.


### Europe and Central Asia

USSR contributed to fall in GDP per capita especiall in the 1988-1992, where it was going through dissolution


### MENA

Oil economies. Continuous pressure by renewables.Limited diversification.


### Latin America and Carribean

Islands relying on tourism and limited diversification



## Countries

Once these categories were analysed I further drilled down to see which countries were the TOP  positive contributors in GDP per capita Growth.

## Performers


I deduced that China, Bosnia and Equatorial Guinea were the top countries in the Income Group and Region Categories and therefore decided to further
analyse as to why they had grown so much.

### Bosnia 

War from 1992 to 1995 . Seperation from Yugoslavia. Market correction of 81.36% and ethen stabilizes 


### Equatorial Guinea

Oil economy. Dscovery of Oil reserves in 1996. Production peaked in 2004 and declined since.


### China

Diversified economy and Manufacturing Hub.



## Forecast

I decided to then use the forecasting tool in PowerBI to see how the GDP per capitas would grow or fall in the next 10 years

The forecasting tool predicted consistency for Equatorial Guinea and Bosnia, while it predicted fall for China .
